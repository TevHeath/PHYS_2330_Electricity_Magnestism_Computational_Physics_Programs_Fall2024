# PHYS 2330: Computational Electricity & Magnetism Programs 


##### 09/01/204 Note: This project was designed to create a more hands-on approach in understanding Physics from a computational and scientific method. Additionally, I wanted to keep a track of all the coding that I did for the Fall 2024. I  started while I am currently a Computer Engineering Student minoring in Physic at the University of Guelph. This is a personal projects for me to develop my coding, programming and scientific computational skills as an undergraduate student. I believe that programming beyond solely the area of computer engineering and within different fields such as physics and numerical computational are an important part of my portfolio to showcase my computer engineering, computational physics, mathematical modeling, and python programming skills.

## Introduction

This respository aims at providing a sample of my abilities and a practice in the form of a improving and maintaining coding and scientific computational skills. This personal challenge is to provide a solution all the computationa physics problems that I will complete over the semester. All of these scripts are 

With my solutions I strive to supply an example of my ability in the following areas:

- problem-solving 
- translation of physis concepts to code
- electrical & computer engineering
- scientific computation
- object-oriented design
- mastery of python 
- data visualization
- 3D graphics
- computational modelling

The original questions can be found within the respository called the FYTT, these exercise are standard question that range from easy to advanced. Although depending one the question they might not require a computational solution.

## General Synopsis


Each of these programs and code can be accessed in their own folder, with corresponding documentation as needed or required within the project or computational ask from the instrcutors.
