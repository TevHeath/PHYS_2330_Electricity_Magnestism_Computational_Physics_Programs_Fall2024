## Introduction

This respository aims at providing a sample of my abilities and a practice in the form of a improving and maintaining coding and scientific computational skills. This personal challenge is to provide a solution all the computationa physics problems that I will complete over the semester. All of these scripts are 

With my solutions I strive to supply an example of my ability in the following areas:

- problem-solving 
- translation of physis concepts to code
- electrical & computer engineering
- scientific computation
- object-oriented design
- mastery of python 
- data visualization
- 3D graphics
- computational modelling

The original questions can be found within the respository called the FYTT, these exercise are standard question that range from easy to advanced. Although depending one the question they might not require a computational solution.

### Electricity & Magnetism Personal Project: Due Date - September 5 to Decemeber 9, 2024
EM Personal project is something that is not contained within the course, but this is the development of a personal projects as a Computer Engineering Student at the University of Guelph. I aimed at applying the field of computational physics with Electrical circuits and physics. I designed my own projects and applied these topics in areas that could serve to be useful int he future for potential employers and researchers.
