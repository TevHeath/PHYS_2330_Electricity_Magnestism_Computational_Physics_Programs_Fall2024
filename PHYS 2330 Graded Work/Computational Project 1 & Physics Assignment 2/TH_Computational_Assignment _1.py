# Computational Exercise 1 for PHYS*2330 - Fall 2024
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## For this assignment, I need two utilize two functions, one given and the other created
# First, a potential function that was created during tutorial
# Second, design electric field function utilizing the Electric Field equation from Class
# Third I will need to plot both of these function on a plot by highlight key components
    #These components are the following, position, charge, density, potential contour, and directional field
#Fourth/Finally, Save your plot(s) as a single image file, “fieldPlot.png”. And name it accordingly.
#Part B requires that I attempt to locate the area that the charges are placed and their charge
