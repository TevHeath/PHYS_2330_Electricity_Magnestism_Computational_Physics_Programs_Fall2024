# Electricity & Magnetism Study Guide Final Assessment Installment Guide

You will be creating your own personal study guide to summarize the course, which we will
divide up into three segments:
1) Coulomb’s law, work & potential energy, electric fields of point charges and charge
distributions (Lectures 1 to 9) – Due Friday Oct 11
2) Electric potential, dipoles, flux, Gauss’s Law (Lectures 10 to 17) – Due Friday Nov 15
3) Gradients, divergence, curl of vector fields in general as well as with respect to
electrostatics, Poisson’s Equation, Laplace Equation, Electric field in matter (Lectures 18
to 24) – Due Monday Dec 9
Your personalized study guide is a document that you create that can be used in your future
studies to remind you of the key concepts and problem-solving strategies that you have
encountered this semester. For each of the three sections in the course, you will include the
following items:
- Key definitions and terminology
- Relevant equations and diagrams (as necessary)
-Three unique worked examples that illustrate the important concepts (not examples
taken from the course notes or the assignments)
